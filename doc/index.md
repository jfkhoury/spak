## `App`

`App` is the root level object/class of your system that all modules in the project can depend on for application resources (providers). In addition the action dispatcher and event bus are also exposed.

`App` is an exported class, but you should never need to `new` up an instance. Instead most modules will simply call a `static` method which in turns message the instance.
If you need access to the instance itself, you can always call `instance()`.

```javascript
// I could do this.
var user = App.instance().user();
// But I think this is better.
var user = App.user();
```

## `App` interface

```typescript
interface App {
    static run(AppComponents, AppConfig, AppDelegate);
    static terminate();
    static session(): ClientSession;
    static user(): User;
    static localize(key: string): String;
    static logger(namespace: string): Logger;
    static events: EventBus;
    static dispatchAction(actionName: string, opts: Object);
    static config: AppConfig;
    bootstrapper: Bootstrapper;
}
```

All of the above `static` methods also can be referenced off the instance, but as shown above, this is usually unnecessary.
